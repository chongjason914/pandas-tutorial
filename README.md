# Pandas Zero to Hero - Beginner's Course to Using Pandas

## What is Pandas?
Pandas is a data manipulation library that is built on top of the Python programming language which allows users to easily and effectively carry out data wrangling, data
manipulation and data visualisation.

## What is Pandas Zero to Hero?
Pandas Zero to Hero is a beginner's tutorial to using the Pandas library. This repo contains the materials that I will use to conduct my weekly tutorial lessons on my 
YouTube channel.

## How will the tutorial be structured?
A new tutorial will be released on a weekly basis and it will be structured such that it builds upon the knowledge from the prior weeks. I will also be importing and working with datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to demonstrate the different concepts in each week's tutorial. 

## What do I hope to accomplish with this tutorial?
I am doing this mainly to inspire and encourage more people to use pandas in their own data analysis work. Furthermore, I want to use this tutorial as means of improving my communication skills as well as my ability to explain concepts in simple but thorough terms.
